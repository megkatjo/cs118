Parts Written:
I wrote the cache section, including the parseDate sections. I also implemented the conditional GET section, which included the logic to send either a response from the cache or get new data.

I wrote the max host connections check. I also wrote the create socket and connect sections. I implemented the persistent connection, as well as the set-up for receiving the request.
